-- [ PLAYER ACTION COMMANDS ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-- When you click on a player within the scoreboard, actions
-- will be displayed. The list below defines what other staff
-- are allowed to do to a player. It is based upon what admin mod
-- you have installed. New ones are always being added for support
-- so if it's not here - it's in the works.
