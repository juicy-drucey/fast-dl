Battery system 
============== 
There is a built in battery system. There are a few options to allow you to do 
multiple things with it. 
 
1.) You can disable the battery system and have a basic tier printer, I don't 
suggest this because players can AFK print and it can crash eco. 
- If this is the case, set the next option to false and skip the battery config. 
 
2.) There is an option in the derma (UI) that allows you to recharge the battery 
and it's as simple as pressing a button. Great for a basic level battery system. 
- If this is the case, configure all of the battery config. 
 
3.) There is an entity based battery system. This involves the player spawning a 
battery and pressing it against the printer. This forces more actions/movement. 
- If this is the case, configure all of the battery config but disable BatteryUI

Adding tier is fairly straight forwards. 
[NUMBER] = {color = COLOR, price = PRICE, amount = AMOUNT, customCheck = CUSTOM} 
 
NUMBER - This is the tier number, so if it was 4, itd be the fourth tier, 
make sure to not miss any numbers else you may encounter issues, 
 
COLOR - This is the color of the tier, it is represented on the left hand 
side of the UI. I suggest keeping it a dark color. 
 
PRICE - This is the price the player will be charged to upgrade to this tier.

AMOUNT - The amount that the printer will print each print period.
 
**Optional** 
CUSTOM - This is an option to run a custom function. Use this to restrict 
tiers to specific things. The example is user groups, however if you have 
the Lua knowledge, you can check it against anything. 

LIMIT - The max amount the printer can hold.
